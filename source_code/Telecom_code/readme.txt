During this D&B project, we encountered many difficulties. Without other groups' help, we would not achieve what we have now. We appreciate them a lot. 

Xiang Ni helped us configure the Bluetooth module and the database. Bowen Wang inspired us to use crawler to get real time images via Wi-Fi connection. Xinhe Liu taught us how to precisely control the trolley by applying gyroscope and PID algorithm. Besides, there are also many friends who have supported us in hardware and software. 

We are exceedling grateful to them.
